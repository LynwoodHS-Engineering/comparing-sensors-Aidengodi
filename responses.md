The Raspberry Pi can sense the enrionment through the electircal signals from the sensors connected to its pins. Like our active sensor the ultrasonic sensor.

Incorrect or Poor wiring can affect these senors. I had my cables flipped a certain way not allowing the fan to work showing how a little displacement can interupt the system. But my wiring for both sensors was also bad so it was not reading the distance for either of them

Coding allows the Raspberry Pi to read the electrical signals it receives. Without any code the Raspberry Pi wouldn't know what actions to peform with the signals.
